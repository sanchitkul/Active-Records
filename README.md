For this assignment, you must create an abstract collection and model class, along with concrete classes for accounts and todos.  Your program should implement record search for all records, find a record by ID, insert record, update record, and delete record functionality.  See the "staticdatabase.php" code for a start on this program, which you can find in the github repo in this unit.   Your program should display a demonstration of each operation in the same way that the string and array program displays data.
